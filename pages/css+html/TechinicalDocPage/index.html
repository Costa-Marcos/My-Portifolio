            <header id="Syntax">Syntax</header>
            <p>
                PHP's syntax is similar to that of C and Perl, and it is designed to be easy to learn for those with a basic understanding of programming. A PHP script is usually embedded within an HTML file, and it begins with an opening PHP tag and ends with a closing PHP tag.

                Variables in PHP are denoted with a dollar sign ($), and they can contain a variety of data types, including strings, integers, and arrays. For example, to declare a string variable in PHP, you would use the following syntax:
            </p>
            <div class="code-text">
                <code>$name = "John Doe";</code>
            </div>
            <P>
                One of the key features of PHP is its support for conditional statements, which allow you to execute certain blocks of code based on certain conditions. For example, the following code demonstrates the use of an if statement:
            </P>
            <div class="code-text">
                <code>
                    $age = 20;
                    if ($age >= 18) {
                        echo "You are an adult.";
                    } else {
                        echo "You are a minor.";
                    }
                </code>
            </div> 
            <p>
                PHP also supports loops, which allow you to repeat a block of code a specified number of times. The most common type of loop in PHP is the for loop, which allows you to iterate over an array or a range of numbers. For example, the following code demonstrates the use of a for loop:
            </p>
            <div class="code-text">
                <code>
                    for ($i = 0; $i < 10; $i++) {
                        echo $i;
                    }
                </code>                
            </div>
            <p>
                In addition to these basic syntax elements, PHP also includes a wide range of built-in functions for common tasks, such as string manipulation, file handling, and database connectivity. These functions can be used to greatly simplify your code and make it easier to maintain.
                <br>

            <p>
                Integration with HTML and other web technologies is a key feature of PHP, allowing developers to create dynamic pages with varying content without reloading the page. PHP code is executed on the server and generates HTML, which is then sent to the client's browser for display. This allows for a separation between the presentation layer (HTML) and the business logic layer (PHP), making it easier to maintain and update the codebase over time.
                <br>
                In addition to HTML, PHP can also integrate with other web technologies such as JavaScript, CSS, and AJAX, providing a complete solution for building dynamic web applications. For example, PHP can be used to retrieve data from a database and present it to the user in an interactive, dynamic way using JavaScript and AJAX. Additionally, PHP can be used to dynamically generate CSS, allowing for the creation of complex stylesheets that adapt to changing data. These integrations offer a wide range of possibilities for building robust and feature-rich web applications, making PHP a popular choice among web developers.
                <br>
                Here is an example of PHP integration with HTML code:

                        <br>$name = "John Doe";
                        <br>echo "&ltp&gtHello, $name!&lt/p&gt";
                        <br>?&gt
                        <br>&ltbody&gt
                        <br>&lt/body&gt
                        <br>&lt/html&gt
                    </code>

                PHP includes a wide range of built-in functions for handling common tasks, making it a highly efficient and productive platform for web development. One such area is file handling, where PHP provides functions for reading, writing, and manipulating files on the server. For example, the fopen() and fwrite() functions allow you to open a file and write data to it, while the fread() and fclose() functions allow you to read data from a file and close it, respectively.
                <br>
                String manipulation is another important area where PHP provides built-in functions for working with strings. For example, the strlen() function returns the length of a string, the substr() function returns a portion of a string, and the strtolower() and strtoupper() functions allow you to convert strings to lowercase or uppercase, respectively. These functions make it easy to work with strings in PHP, whether you are working with plain text or other data formats.
                <br>
                Finally, PHP provides a set of functions and libraries for database connectivity, enabling you to connect to databases, execute queries, and retrieve results. For example, the mysqli_connect() function allows you to connect to a MySQL database, while the mysqli_query() function allows you to execute a query. Additionally, the mysqli_fetch_array() function retrieves the results of a query as an array, making it easy to work with the data in your application. These functions and libraries make it simple to interact with databases and store, retrieve, and manipulate data in your web applications.
                <br>
                Here is an example of a PHP built-in function code:
                <div class="code-text">
                    <code>
                        <br><?php
                        <br>// Example of strtoupper() function
                        <br>$text = "Hello World!";
                        <br>$uppercase_text = strtoupper($text);
                        <br>
                        <br>echo $uppercase_text; 
                        <br>// Output: HELLO WORLD!
                        <br>?>
                    </code>
